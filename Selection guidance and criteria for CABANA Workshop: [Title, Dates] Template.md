## Reference information for workshop:

Selection committee for workshop
[Name of Selection committee member 1]
[Name of Selection committee member 2]
[Name of Selection committee member 3]
Applications close: [Date and time]
Selections begin: [Date and time]
Once selections are complete, the committee need to discuss (by email / meeting any Maybe/unsure applications and decide on the successful and waiting list applicants by [Date and time], so notification emails can be sent to the right people at the right time.
Check to ensure only 1 delegate from a lab group attends the workshop, and ideally, you should look for people attending the workshop to teach their lab group / institute members. 
Equality, diversity and inclusion check: Check country of employment and gender, as well as ethnic minority in their country of employment.
A few applicants may have been strategically invited based on their participation in the CABANA project, if this is the case, this should be clearly and openly discussed during the selection process, with conflicts of interest noted (i.e. if you know or work with them, etc.)
When selecting trainees, please assess all applications based on whether they are suitable to attend or not; do not go through the applications and confirm their success yet. It is okay for the initial number of selection applicants to be higher than the workshop capacity of [total number of trainees for workshop i.e 30]. You can then sort these applications by their final suitability to attend (i.e. those who would benefit most from attendance)

Selection committee selection

Selecting the appropriate selection committee is important to ensure the right participants attend the workshop.

Generally, three people are needed for selection. These should be the course organizers and/or trainers. It is the responsibility of course organizers to put together the right selection committee. It is also good practice to have diversity within the committee so all aspects of an application (including travel fellowship selections) are considered.

What does diversity look like? Aspects to consider when putting together a selection committee:
Expertise in workshop topics/themes
Gender representation
Ethnic minority representation

Sometimes this can be difficult to put together, but every effort should be made to ensure a fair selection committee is put together.


In addition, a member of the CABANA workshop workstream should look over all selections to assess fairness of the process and to flag any issues and feed them back to the selection committee / course organizers.
Currently, the CABANA workshop workstream team are: Guilherme Oliveira, Cei Abreu Goodger, Gisele Nunes and Piv Gopalasingam.
Participant selection for workshop

Once application responses are available in a spreadsheet, filters should be added for each question, making sure each member of the selection committee has space in the spreadsheet to triage applications and provide comments.

Necessary criteria can be specified in the “audience” section of a course webpage and if this was the case, these criteria can serve as a good first-pass filter. 

Country of origin and employment: 
Applicants should be based in Latin America, those who are not are automatically excluded.
Edge case: if a Latin American from outside Latin America wishes to apply/has applied, further information is needed - if they are moving back to Latin America (and have definite future employment there) then this can be considered.
Edge case: non-Latin Americans who are working in Latin America are eligible to apply for courses.
Applicants from Chile and Uruguay (and any other non-LMIC country) should be excluded.

Career stage: 
Workshops are generally for postgraduates upwards: PhD student, postdoctoral researchers, junior investigators, assistant professors etc.
MSc students are admitted in some circumstances too.
Undergraduates should be excluded, unless the workshop specified undergraduate applications are welcomed (this will have to be discussed with other members of the organizing committee and workshop workstream team before opening applications for the course) or if they are undertaking an MSc immediately after.

Have they previously attended a CABANA workshop or were awarded a CABANA travel fellowship award?
If yes, the applicant should be excluded. This is so that another trainee can benefit from attending a workshop (or be awarded a travel fellowship).
If after selections have taken place, you still want to invite them to attend the workshop, offer them attendance without a travel fellowship.


The most important aspects of a good workshop participant thereafter, are:

Participant having the necessary scientific background for the workshop
Participant demonstrates the benefit of the workshop to their research and/or goals
Participant demonstrates the benefit of the workshop to their group/institution

Once first-pass selection has taken place, check and make a note of the gender and ethnic minority balance: it is important here to ensure there is good gender balance, representative of the selection pool.


Selection of [Travel] fellowship awardees

From an eligible Latin American country
CABANA partner countries take priority, non-CABANA partner countries next (as long as they are not non-LMIC countries)
Strong connection of the workshop with their project
Distance from workshop venue requires significant travel plans (8 hour + coach, flights).
Participant is from an underrepresented ethnic background. See wikipedia table for more information.
Gender and race of applicants should be routinely checked throughout the process to ensure balance.

**Note: Ensure 50/50 gender balance if there are more men than women applying, and IF more women than men apply, then maintain that proportion (i.e. if 60:40 women apply, then maintain 60:40 proportion in the final pool). The CABANA project as a whole specifies that at least 30% of participants come from underrepresented groups.

Filtering algorithm

1st check: Applicants should be Latin American and working in Latin American country
-some may have entered wrong information here, but may have provided an institution name to follow up on.
Applicants working in Chile, Uruguay and any other non-LMIC country in Latin America are automatically excluded.

2nd check: Career stage (Asst Prof/Lecturer, Postdoc, PhD student)
Undergraduates are automatically excluded
Free text responses are checked at this point. In most cases these will become maybe.
Research associate is a synonym for postdoctoral researcher
Industry-based applicants should preferably be young and have had exposure to genomics. Job titles and designations here are highly variable.
Here, seeing how long the applicant has been conducting research may be useful.


3rd check
Application questions
Relevance of course to their research - can they readily apply it?
Can they share their knowledge with their group/institution?

Potential 4th check - if more than 25-30 applicants make it to this stage
R and Unix familiarity / use of bioinformatics tools
Applicants who have some experience in R and Unix may “hit the ground running” with the workshop.
If you are running an R/Unix/Python workshop, this question may be as important as the other application questions.


Aim to select 25-30 participants, with a reserve list of 5-6.

Once selections are complete, up to 30% of the total workshop attendance number (e.g. for 30, 10 travel fellowships should be awarded), based on:

Whether the applicant asked for a fellowship
Reasons for requesting a fellowship
Distance to travel to workshop
Gender/ethnic minority status

Please note: It is the responsibility of the selection committee to select travel fellowship awardees.
After selection
Emails need to be ready to send to:
Successful applicants with fellowship
Successful applicants with no fellowship
Waiting list applicants 
Unsuccessful applicants

Once all emails are sent out, it will be important to keep track of who accepted the invitations, and to obtain any further information for attendees to provide you, e.g. passport details, date of arrival, date of departure, if they are staying for any events post-course (i.e. a symposium), if they are happy to share rooms etc.). This information can either be stored within the workshop google folder as a separate spreadsheet, or a separate sheet within the selections spreadsheet.

For monitoring purposes, it is important for the final participant list to be provided within the workshop folder.
